# Solutions to Advent of Code problems

I started learning Go a little while ago, and decided to participate in Advent of Code 2020 to improve my skills. Now, I'm starting from the beginning and sharing my solutions. In general, I am optimizing code for readability and testability over speed of development, performance, and cleverness. The goal is to learn good habits in Go, rather than make the best use of every microsecond of processing time or go code golfing.
